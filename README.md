EMPOWER proxy server
====================

An express proxy server meant to remove x-frame-options headers from responses.
Use/copy/run/fiddle at your own risk,
I take no personal responsibility for whatever happens if you decide to use this code

### INSTALL
Acquire or generate key.pem and cert.pem ( openssl works fine ) then put them in the root folder of the project.
Then cd into directory and run 'npm install'

### TESTS
There are none... this is intended to be a temporary stopgap measure until the empower server is configured correctly

### LINT
Not configured

### RUN
cd into directory and run 'npm start -- [HOSTNAME]'

### TROUBLESHOOT
None, run it at your own risk
